# Session Summary - October 30, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Registration 409 Conflict Error âœ…

**Problem:**
- Users were getting `409 Conflict` error with message "Un utilisateur avec ces informations existe dÃ©jÃ " when trying to complete registration
- Even after deleting users from database, the error persisted
- Debug logs showed the query was incorrectly matching users with completely different emails/phones

**Root Cause:**
- The Drizzle migration from Prisma was incomplete
- The `buildWhereConditions()` function in `src/lib/db/helpers.ts` didn't properly handle complex queries with `OR`, `NOT`, and `AND` clauses
- The query was returning incorrect results, causing false positives

**Solution:**
1. **Immediate Fix (verify-and-create-account/route.ts):**
   - Replaced broken Prisma-compatible query with raw Drizzle queries
   - Used raw `or()` and `eq()` functions to properly handle OR clauses
   - Filtered temporary users in JavaScript (more reliable than complex SQL)
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Architectural Fix (helpers.ts):**
   - Fixed `buildWhereConditions()` to properly handle:
     - `OR` clauses (recursive)
     - `AND` clauses (recursive)
     - `NOT` clauses (recursive)
   - Separated top-level operators from regular column conditions
   - Added `deleteMany()` method to user helper

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/auth/verify-and-create-account/route.ts`
- `src/lib/db/helpers.ts`

### 2. Phone Format Generation Bug âœ…

**Problem:**
- For phone numbers with country codes other than Senegal (+221), the code was generating invalid formats
- Example: `+18193182192` (US/Canada) would generate `+221+18193182192` which is invalid
- This affected 8 files across the codebase

**Root Cause:**
- Hardcoded logic assumed all phones were Senegal numbers (+221)
- Code always tried to add `+221` prefix, even when phone already had a different country code

**Solution:**
1. **Created Utility Function (`src/lib/utils.ts`):**
   - Added `generatePhoneFormats(phone: string)` function
   - Intelligently detects country code from phone number
   - Generates only valid format variants:
     - Original normalized format (e.g., `+18193182192`)
     - Local number only (e.g., `8193182192`)
     - Without `+` sign (e.g., `18193182192`)
   - Removes duplicates automatically

2. **Updated All Occurrences:**
   - Replaced all hardcoded phone format generation with the new utility function
   - Updated 8 files across the codebase

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/utils.ts` (added function)
- `src/app/api/auth/verify-and-create-account/route.ts`
- `src/lib/otp.ts` (3 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/auth/send-otp/route.ts` (2 occurrences)
- `src/app/api/auth/check-availability/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts` (2 occurrences)
- `src/lib/auth.ts`

## Technical Improvements

### Database Query Layer
- Fixed Prisma-to-Drizzle compatibility layer to handle complex queries
- Improved query reliability and correctness
- Added proper support for nested OR/NOT/AND clauses

### Code Reusability
- Created centralized utility function for phone format generation
- Removed code duplication across 8 files
- Easier to maintain and update phone format logic in the future

### Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging in verify-and-create-account endpoint
- Logs show which users are found and why conflicts occur

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority ðŸ”´

1. **Complete Drizzle Migration Audit**
   - Review all 28 API endpoints that use `prisma` helper
   - Test complex queries (OR, NOT, AND combinations) in each endpoint
   - Create integration tests for registration flow
   - Document any remaining Prisma compatibility issues

2. **Create Automated Tests**
   - Set up Vitest or Jest testing framework
   - Create test suite for registration flow:
     - Test OTP bypass in test mode
     - Test duplicate email detection
     - Test duplicate phone detection
     - Test temporary user cleanup
     - Test phone format handling for different country codes
   - Add unit tests for `generatePhoneFormats()` function
   - Add unit tests for `buildWhereConditions()` function

3. **Database Query Testing**
   - Test `buildWhereConditions()` with various query combinations:
     - Simple queries (single condition)
     - OR queries (multiple alternatives)
     - NOT queries (exclusions)
     - Combined OR + NOT queries
     - Nested AND/OR queries
   - Verify all queries return correct results

### Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡

4. **Phone Number Validation Enhancement**
   - Consider using `libphonenumber-js` more extensively (already imported)
   - Enhance `generatePhoneFormats()` to use `libphonenumber-js` for better country code detection
   - Add validation to ensure phone formats are valid before database queries

5. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add more specific error messages for different conflict scenarios
   - Log database query results for debugging
   - Add request ID tracking for better error tracing

6. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove debug console.log statements after verifying fixes work
   - Consider moving phone format generation logic to a separate service file
   - Add JSDoc comments to all utility functions

### Low Priority ðŸŸ¢

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider caching phone format arrays for frequently used numbers
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexes on email/phone columns
   - Review query performance for bulk operations

8. **Documentation**
   - Document phone format handling patterns
   - Document database query patterns (when to use helpers vs raw Drizzle)
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for Drizzle migration

9. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Add monitoring for registration success/failure rates
   - Alert on unusual 409 conflict patterns
   - Track phone format generation errors

## Testing Checklist

Before considering this work complete, verify:

- [ ] Registration flow works for Senegal phone numbers (+221)
- [ ] Registration flow works for other country codes (e.g., +1, +33, +44)
- [ ] No false 409 conflicts occur
- [ ] Temporary users are properly cleaned up
- [ ] All phone format variants are correctly generated
- [ ] Database queries return correct results
- [ ] No invalid phone formats are generated (e.g., `+221+18193182192`)

---

## Notes

- All changes have been tested for linting errors (none found)
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to API contracts
- Debug logging can be removed after verification

---

## Questions for Future Consideration

1. Should we fully migrate away from Prisma compatibility layer and use raw Drizzle everywhere?
2. Should we support phone numbers without country codes (assume Senegal)?
3. Should we add phone number validation at the API level before database queries?
4. Should we implement rate limiting specifically for registration attempts?
