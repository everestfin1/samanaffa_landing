# InTouch Callback Fix Summary

## Date: January 9, 2025

## Problem Identified

Payment intent statuses were not updating after InTouch payments were completed. The root cause was an **authentication mismatch** between what InTouch sends and what our callback endpoint expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Critical Issue: Authentication Mismatch

According to the InTouch API documentation (INTOUCH_DOCS.md, lines 71-75), InTouch webhooks use **Basic Authentication**:

```
Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>
```

However, our callback endpoint was configured to expect:
- HMAC signatures via `x-intouch-signature` header
- Which InTouch doesn't send

**Result**: All InTouch callbacks were likely being rejected with `401 Unauthorized` errors, preventing transaction status updates.

### Secondary Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: No Basic Auth credentials configured
2. **Insufficient Logging**: No visibility into whether callbacks were arriving or why they were failing
3. **No Testing Tools**: Difficult to diagnose and test callback processing

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Callback Authentication (`src/app/api/payments/intouch/callback/route.ts`)

✅ **Added Basic Authentication Support**
- Extracts `Authorization: Basic` header
- Decodes and verifies username/password
- Configurable via `INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

✅ **Maintained HMAC Signature Verification**
- Kept existing HMAC verification as optional fallback
- Allows dual authentication methods

✅ **Flexible Authentication**
- Works with Basic Auth (InTouch's method)
- Works with HMAC signatures (if InTouch adds them later)
- Allows unsigned callbacks for testing (`INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS=true`)

### 2. Comprehensive Logging

Added detailed logging throughout the callback flow:

- **Request arrival**: Method, headers, query params
- **Authentication**: Which method used, success/failure
- **Payload parsing**: Extracted fields and values
- **Status mapping**: Raw status → Mapped status
- **Database lookup**: Transaction found/not found
- **Status updates**: Old status → New status
- **Balance updates**: Account balance changes
- **Email notifications**: When sent
- **Response**: HTTP status code returned

All logs prefixed with `[Intouch Callback]` for easy filtering.

### 3. Environment Configuration (`env.example`)

Added required environment variables:

```bash
# Basic Auth credentials (request from InTouch team)
INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="your-webhook-username"
INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="your-webhook-password"

# Optional HMAC signature verification
INTOUCH_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-webhook-secret-here"

# Allow unsigned callbacks during testing
INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="true"  # Set to false in production
```

### 4. Testing Utilities

Created two diagnostic scripts:

#### `scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts`
Tests the callback endpoint end-to-end:
- Fetches real transaction from database
- Sends test callbacks (GET, POST JSON, POST form-urlencoded)
- Includes Basic Auth headers
- Verifies database updates
- Checks balance changes

Usage:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts SAMA_NAFFA-DEPOSIT-1234567890-ABC123 200
```

#### `scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts`
Diagnoses transaction status issues:
- Lists all pending transactions
- Shows transactions with callbacks that didn't update
- Identifies missing provider IDs
- Displays recent completed transactions
- Provides summary statistics

Usage:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts
```

### 5. Updated Documentation (`project_docs/INTOUCH_CALLBACK_CONFIGURATION.md`)

Enhanced with:
- Clear explanation of Basic Auth requirement
- Environment variable configuration guide
- Testing procedures with new scripts
- Troubleshooting guide with common issues
- Log patterns to look for
- Questions to ask InTouch team

## Next Steps - ACTION REQUIRED

### Immediate Actions

1. **Request Basic Auth Credentials from InTouch**
   
   Contact the InTouch team and ask:
   > "What are the Basic Authentication username and password we should use to verify webhook callbacks to our endpoint: `https://samanaffa.com/api/payments/intouch/callback`?"

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   
   Once you receive the credentials, add them to your production environment:
   ```bash
   INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="<username-from-intouch>"
   INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="<password-from-intouch>"
   ```

3. **Set Callback Security for Production**
   
   In production, disable unsigned callbacks:
   ```bash
   INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="false"
   ```

4. **Test Locally First**
   
   Before credentials arrive, test locally with:
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="true"
   
   # Run test script
   npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts
   npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts <reference-number> 200
   ```

5. **Ask InTouch to Send Test Callback**
   
   Once credentials are configured:
   - Ask InTouch to send a test callback
   - Check your server logs for `[Intouch Callback]` entries
   - Verify "Basic Auth verification PASSED"
   - Confirm transaction status updates

### Monitoring & Verification

#### Check Server Logs

Look for these patterns after a payment:

**Successful flow:**
```
[Intouch Callback] POST request received
[Intouch Callback] Authorization header present: Basic
[Intouch Callback] Basic Auth - Username received: xxx
[Intouch Callback] Basic Auth verification PASSED
[Intouch Callback] Processing callback data...
[Intouch Callback] Transaction intent found
[Intouch Callback] Transaction processing completed
```

**Failed authentication:**
```
[Intouch Callback] POST request received
[Intouch Callback] Basic Auth verification FAILED
```

#### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check if callbacks are arriving
grep "Intouch Callback" /path/to/logs

# Find pending transactions
npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts

# Test specific transaction
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts <reference-number> 200
```

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

1. InTouch sends callback with `Authorization: Basic <base64>`
2. Our endpoint extracts and decodes credentials
3. Compares against `INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`
4. If match → Process callback
5. If no match → Return 401 Unauthorized
6. If credentials not configured but `ALLOW_UNSIGNED=true` → Process anyway (testing only)

### Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing HMAC signature verification still works
- Supports both GET and POST callbacks
- Handles JSON and form-urlencoded payloads
- No changes to database schema
- No changes to transaction intent creation flow

### Security Considerations

✅ **Production Ready**
- Basic Auth credentials stored as environment variables (not in code)
- Credentials redacted in logs
- Allow unsigned callbacks disabled in production
- Supports dual authentication (Basic Auth + HMAC)

✅ **Testing Friendly**
- Can enable unsigned callbacks for local testing
- Test scripts don't require real InTouch integration
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Questions for InTouch Team

When contacting InTouch, ask:

1. **Authentication**: What are the Basic Auth username/password for our webhook endpoint?
2. **Testing**: Can you send a test callback to verify integration?
3. **Callback Method**: Do you send callbacks as GET or POST? (we support both)
4. **Retry Logic**: Do you retry failed callbacks? How many attempts?
5. **Timeout**: What is your callback timeout threshold?
6. **IP Whitelist**: Do we need to whitelist specific IPs?

## Summary

### What Was Broken
- InTouch callbacks were likely returning 401 (authentication failure)
- Transaction statuses weren't updating
- No visibility into the problem

### What's Fixed
- ✅ Basic Authentication support (InTouch's required method)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for diagnostics
- ✅ Testing utilities for local validation
- ✅ Updated documentation and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing security measures

### What You Need to Do
1. Get Basic Auth credentials from InTouch
2. Add them to environment variables
3. Test with their test callback
4. Monitor logs for successful processing
5. Disable unsigned callbacks in production

## Support

If you continue experiencing issues after implementing these fixes:

1. Run diagnostic script: `npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts`
2. Check server logs for `[Intouch Callback]` patterns
3. Test locally: `npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts <ref> 200`
4. Review troubleshooting guide in `INTOUCH_CALLBACK_CONFIGURATION.md`

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

All code changes, utilities, and documentation have been implemented. The only remaining step is obtaining Basic Auth credentials from the InTouch team and configuring them in your environment.
