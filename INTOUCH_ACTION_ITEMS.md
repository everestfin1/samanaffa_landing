# InTouch Payment Callback - Action Items

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Contact InTouch Team (URGENT)

**Email the InTouch team with this request:**

```
Subject: Basic Authentication Credentials for Webhook Callback

Hello InTouch Team,

We need the Basic Authentication credentials to verify webhook callbacks 
for our payment integration.

Our webhook endpoint:
https://samanaffa.com/api/payments/intouch/callback

According to your API documentation, callbacks are secured with Basic 
Authentication. Please provide:
- Username for webhook authentication
- Password for webhook authentication

Also, could you please send a test callback to this endpoint to verify 
the integration is working correctly?

Thank you!
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables (Once Received)

Add these to your production `.env` file:

```bash
# Replace with actual credentials from InTouch
INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="username-from-intouch"
INTOUCH_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="password-from-intouch"

# Set to false in production
INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="false"
```

### 3. Test the Integration

#### Step 1: Check current state
```bash
# See all pending transactions
npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts
```

#### Step 2: Test callback locally (before InTouch credentials)
```bash
# Enable unsigned callbacks for testing
# Add to .env.local:
INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="true"

# Test with a real transaction reference
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts <YOUR-REFERENCE-NUMBER> 200
```

#### Step 3: After InTouch sends credentials
```bash
# Update .env with credentials
# Ask InTouch to send a test callback
# Check server logs for "[Intouch Callback]" entries
```

### 4. Monitor Production Logs

After deployment, watch for these log patterns:

**‚úÖ Success (what you want to see):**
```
[Intouch Callback] POST request received
[Intouch Callback] Basic Auth verification PASSED
[Intouch Callback] Transaction processing completed
```

**‚ùå Failure (what to fix):**
```
[Intouch Callback] Basic Auth verification FAILED
‚Üí Check credentials match what InTouch is sending
```

```
[Intouch Callback] Transaction intent NOT FOUND
‚Üí Check reference number format
```

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Contacted InTouch team for Basic Auth credentials
- [ ] Received username and password from InTouch
- [ ] Added credentials to production `.env` file
- [ ] Set `INTOUCH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_CALLBACKS="false"` in production
- [ ] Deployed updated code to production
- [ ] Asked InTouch to send test callback
- [ ] Verified test callback succeeded in logs
- [ ] Made a real test payment through the UI
- [ ] Confirmed transaction status updated to COMPLETED
- [ ] Confirmed user balance updated correctly
- [ ] Confirmed email notification was sent

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If callbacks still don't work:

1. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for InTouch callback entries
   grep "Intouch Callback" /path/to/application/logs
   ```

2. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts
   ```

3. **Test manually:**
   ```bash
   # Test callback endpoint is accessible
   curl https://samanaffa.com/api/payments/intouch/callback
   
   # Should return: {"status":"Intouch webhook endpoint active"}
   ```

4. **Check InTouch configuration:**
   - Confirm they have your callback URL
   - Confirm they're sending callbacks
   - Ask for sample request they're sending

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Verify Basic Auth credentials match |
| 404 Not Found | Check reference number format |
| Transaction not updating | Enable logging, check for callbacks arriving |
| No callbacks arriving | Confirm InTouch has your callback URL configured |

## üõ†Ô∏è UTILITY SCRIPTS

### Test Callback Processing
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts <reference-number> <status>

# Examples:
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts SAMA_NAFFA-DEPOSIT-1234567890-ABC123 200
npx tsx scripts/test-intouch-callback.ts SAMA_NAFFA-DEPOSIT-1234567890-ABC123 420
```

### Check Pending Transactions
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-pending-transactions.ts
```

## üìû QUESTIONS TO ASK INTOUCH

1. ‚úÖ What are the Basic Auth credentials for our webhook?
2. Can you send a test callback to verify our integration?
3. What method do you use: GET or POST? (we support both)
4. Do you retry failed callbacks? How many times?
5. What's your callback timeout threshold?
6. Are there specific IPs we should whitelist?

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After completing these actions:

1. ‚úÖ InTouch callbacks will successfully authenticate
2. ‚úÖ Transaction statuses will update automatically
3. ‚úÖ User balances will update immediately
4. ‚úÖ Email notifications will be sent
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logs will be available for monitoring
